        <h1>Mashaal Ahmed</h1>
        <h2>A small intro about myself</h2>
        <h6>Psst...wanna see how I end up developing this website? <a href="https://github.com/mashaal95/mywebberino">Click here!</a></h6>       
        <p>
            I am a Masters of Information Technology graduate from Monash University. My skillset basically lies in Mobile Application Development (Android & iOS), ASP .NET MVC application development and Data Visualization in R. <br> <br>
        
        I used to work as an IT Helpdesk Support which was my gateway into the IT World. Here, I learnt how to provide technical assistance to people and mainly, to support and solve common IT problems that occur in the office. To supplement this experience, I also worked at a computer store, wherein I learnt about computer hardware and software and basically, how to fix issues in both. <br> <br>
        
        To formalize this experience, I used my degree as a stepping stone towards greater things. During the course of my degree, I was exposed to various technologies which, thankfully, I became proficient in. I was lucky enough to score a Summer Internship in my university, which helped me in gaining a foothold in a different sphere of IT. <br> <br>
        
        In my spare time, I usually experiment with Linux distributions and their inner workings. Virtualization is basically a hobby of mine. <br> <br>
        
        Currently, I am working as an ICT Help Desk Support Officer to get started with the IT World in Australia :D
